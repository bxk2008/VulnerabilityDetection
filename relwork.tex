In \cite{DBLP:conf/ndss/LiZXO0WDZ18}, the authors present a deep learning-based system for vulnerability detection, called VulDeePecker.
 The features are obtained by first extracting code gadgets from the buggy programs, and then transformed into vector representations,
 where the code gadgets are fragments of codes that are semantically related to each other.
 The learning algorithm is based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
 Experimental evaluation on the public available vulnerability dataset demonstrates that VulDeePecker outperforms the other state-of-the-art 
 code similarity-based vulnerability detection systems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
