%{\color{red} TODO: formalize the modeling and verification approach, and then carry out the 5G protocol case study.}
%The formal analysis of security protocols is supported by a vast space of modelling formalisms and tools.
%The variety of incompatible formats and tools however poses a significant challenge to practical adoption as well as continued research.
%In this paper, we propose a  unified modeling and verification framework for security protocols.
%The modeling framework is based on UML and has been designed for ease of verification without sacrificing readability.
%Several existing tools are integrated as the verification backend, such as ProVerif, Scyther, Tarmarin.
%A transformer has also been implemented to automatically transform the UML model to the one supported by a specific verifier.
%The ultimate purpose of this work is to simplify tool development, encourage research cooperation, and pave the
%way towards a future competition in security protocol verification.
